                    In November, I join the construction work with the substitute civilian
                    servicemen. As I said before the design of the pond is the most important
                    step during the construction, including the size, the aim, and the
                    traffic flow, as a result having a good design can achieve the purpose of
                    application and management of the pond. During the construction, pay
                    attention in each step is important too, especially maintain the level of the
                    construct. If the level isnâ€™t balanced than it might cause the construction
                    problem, also if there are any problems after the construct is done, it will
                    take more time, more budget, and manpower to repair it.
