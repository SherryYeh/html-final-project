            In September, I still focus on the broadstock culture Milkfish are fish that lay eggs at night, as a result on the next day we need to avoid the eggs under the sunshine. In the morning after observed the eggs that are slightly transparent and yellowish on the surface of the water, we use the egg collection net to collect the fish eggs.
