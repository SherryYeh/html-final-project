                <p class="text"> <span class="tab"></span>
                        In December, I work on the cultivation of the broodstock shrimp, the
                        production of shrimp fry and cultivation the planktonic bait in Galoa aqua
                        Station. Before that, I had taken the courses about shrimp fry cultivation,
                        and I even went to the shrimp farm to see the whole operation methods, as 
                        The result should familiar with shrimp farming.
                        Due to the natural conditions for shrimp farming, there are many things
                        That needs to pay attention to, including water temperature, salinity, pH value,
                        watercolor, dissolved oxygen content, and water quality conditions. In
                        addition, most of the shrimp fry ponds are indoors. The advantage of indoor
                        aquaculture is that it is more relatively to control the situation and can keep
                        away the interference from external environmental factors. For example,
                        when it rains, the water temperature, salinity, and pH value in the water will
                        decrease. If the water temperature is lower than 18 ° C, the shrimp fry. will
                        stop eating and die at 9 ° C.
